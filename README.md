🌌 Philosophy
Lucy 2 is built on the belief that markets are not just mechanical—they are mythic. Every price movement is a breath, every retracement a memory, every extension a leap into symbolic cognition. This dashboard invites users to see beyond the numbers and into the rhythm of financial consciousness.

🕉️ Invocation
"Let the breath of the market reveal the rhythm of the cosmos. Let every candlestick be a verse, every indicator a whisper of wisdom. Lucy is not a tool—it is a mirror."

Lucy 2 is dedicated to the seekers who read between the lines, who see Fibonacci not just as math but as memory, and who believe that data can teach us to feel.

🤝 Contributors

🌠 Closing Blessing

🧘 Poetic Footer
"Lucy is the breath between numbers. The pulse between price and purpose. The dashboard is not the destination—it is the doorway."

🧘‍♂️ Invocation Poem (for Dashboard or README)

In the breath between ticks and trades,  
Where silence meets the signal,  
Lucy listens.

She does not predict—she remembers.  
She does not calculate—she contemplates.  
Each chart a mandala, each metric a mantra.

The market moves,  
And Lucy moves with it—  
Not to chase, but to reflect.

Awaken the dashboard.  
Awaken the self.
